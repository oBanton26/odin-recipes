        <p><em>A stack of french crepes, looking freaking good !!</em></p>

        <p>The french crepes - or juste crepes, are the easiest and most delicious deserts or meals you can make. That's it really.</p>
        <p>My recipe is maybe the easiest one because you only need three basic ingredients.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>I said 3 ingredients and I'm a man of my word so trust me.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add a pyramid of flour</li>
            <li>Add 2 or 3 eggs depending on the size of it</li>
            <li>Add water and mix to a texture that seems pleasing (oh how I hate recipes that leaves you hanging experienceless)</li>
        </ol>
