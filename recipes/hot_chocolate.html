        <p><em>A good hot chocolate to give you some strength in a cold winter morning !</em></p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The hot chocolate isn't a recipe that seems important but to me it is. So suck it.</p>
        <p>My recipe is maybe the easiest one because you only need three basic ingredients (hehe it's the same sentence as for the crepes recipe)</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cacao powder</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Boiling water</li>
            <li>Okay now you can had milk if you're a baby</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil your water</li>
            <li>Mix in your recipient the cacao powder and some sugar</li>
            <li>Add the boiling water to almost fill your mug</li>
            <li>Add some milk or cream to make it sweeter if you want (you baby...)</li>
        </ol>
